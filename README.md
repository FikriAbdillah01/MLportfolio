# Fikri Abdillah | Data Science Portfolio

Hi
I'am Fikri. Physics graduate of Institut Teknologi Kalimantan. This portfolio is compilance of my data science and data analyst project I have done for self-learing, hobby, and curiousity purposes. This also contains my archievements, skills, and certificates. It is on updated on the regular basis

## Projects

<img align="right" width="250" height="150" src="figure/iowa_real_estate.jpg"> **[House Price Prediction](https://github.com/FikriAbdillah01/house-price-prediction)**

A data-driven exploration of how property features shape market value. This project aims to predict house prices using regression models trained on structured housing data. It covers data cleaning, feature engineering, data exploration, and model comparison (Random Forest, XGBoost), with a focus on clarity and tranparency.

<img align = 'right' width = "250" height = "150" src = "figure/credit_card.jpg">**[Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://github.com/FikriAbdillah01/credit-card-fraud-analysis)**

The objective in this project is build a model that can detect fraud on the credit card transaction. The dataset consist a 48 hours transaction with more than 20 columns. This project demonstrate the influence of the three preprocessing method such as raw, Imputation, and Isolation Forest on the accuracy of fraud detection.

<img align = 'right' width = "250" height = "150" src = "figure/wine.jpg">**[Wine Quality Detection](https://github.com/FikriAbdillah01/wine_analysis.git)**

Wine is a fermented grape drink. This project uses data sourced from the UCL repository. As the title suggests, the goal is to explore wine composition and predict its quality using a machine learning model. I've also created a [note]() containing an in-depth discussion of wine composition. I applied the ROC AUC curve to see the classification performance of machine learning.

## On Going Projects

<img align = 'right' width = "250" height = "150" src = "figure/churn_analysis.jpg">**[Churn Analysis](https://github.com/FikriAbdillah01/customer-churn.git)**

Churn is a phenomenon or event where customers decide to leave a company's services. This is common in telecommunications or technology companies that provide services. Churn analysis can help us identify patterns and factors that lead to customer churn. In this project, we will explore customer behaviour dataset. I also applied machine learning models to predict churn.

<img align = 'right' width = "250" height = "150" src = "figure/sentiment_analysis.png">**[AI Chatbot Sentiment Analysis in Google Play](https://github.com/FikriAbdillah01/ai-sentiment-analysis.git)**

In this project, I analyzed the sentiment of an AI chatbot available on Google Play using over 10,000 data sets scraped using the google play scraper. This project included several preprocessing steps such as text cleaning, stopword removal, tokenization, data exploration, and applied sentiment analysis methods such as lexicon-based analysis and TextBlob.

<img align = 'right' width = "250" height = "150" src = "figure/gdp_fig.jpg">**[Gross Domestic Product Prediction](https://github.com/FikriAbdillah01/gdp-prediction)**

The goal of this project is to create a GDP prediction that robust to some macroeconomic events. The data source from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) is retrieved using the API. This project utilizes several regression models, e.g. simple linear regression and regularized linear regression, with the data divided into several year groups to obtain the smallest prediction error score.

The budget-efficiency and time is the important things for wine-maker to create a high-quality wine. The given dataset have several variables of wine and quality become the output. In this analysis, we will use 2 simple model, linear regression, and logistic regression, and utilize hyperparameter to find out the best parameter in terms of accuracy. (`Result and conclusion`)

Wine is the fermented juics of the grape and become the luxury symbol for mid-to-high class. Wine is not only drinkable, but also became one of many ingredients for cook. However, there are certain kind of grape that can be fermented. The grape genus Vitis (e.g. *Vitis vinifera* or called European grape) is one of them. This grape have been developed and recently reported that about 5000 wines is made from this grape. 

Italy be the most export 

The following table is the physicochemical variables of wine:

| No | Variables |
| :-: | :-: |
| 1 | `fixed acidity` |
| 2 | `volatile acidity` |
| 3 | `citric acid` |
| 4 | `residual sugar` |
| 5 | `chlorides` |
| 6 | `free sulfur dioxide` |
| 7 | `density` |
| 8 | `pH` |
| 9 | `sulphates` |
| 10 | `alcohol` |

We will give a brief explanation of these physicochemical variables in the list.
